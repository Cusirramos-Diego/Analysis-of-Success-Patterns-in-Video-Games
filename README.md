This is Sprint 6 Project from Diego Cusirramos for Data Analyst Bootcamp 2025.  This analysis was carried out with the aim of identifying patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not for the online store called Ice, which sells video games worldwide; and thus detect promising projects and plan advertising campaigns.
